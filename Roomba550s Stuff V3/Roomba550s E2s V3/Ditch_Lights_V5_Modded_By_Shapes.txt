    #V5.2
    #Magnum if you are reading this then fuck you for nerfing this.
    #Setup Instructions
    #1- Configure the E2... There shouldn't be much you'll want to change, except maybe "On."
    #2- Place this E2 somewhere with the rest of your wire stuff on the locomotive.
    #3- Place two Wire Lights (With NO boxes ticked!) at each end of the locomotive according to the FRA Standards below. Putting them on the rear end is optional.
    #4- (If you want the lights to flash): Wire Enable_Front and Enable_Rear (If Used) to a pair of Toggled Buttons in the cab,
    #and wire Horn to whichever Pod Controller output controls the Horn.
    #5- (If you want the lights to come on with the headlights): Wire Headlights_Front and Headlights_Rear to whatever controls the headlights on your locomotive.
    #6- (If you want the Bell to come on when you honk the horn): Wire your Bell to the Bell output on the E2, and wire BellToggle to a Pod Controller output or a Button (NON-Toggled)!
    #7- Wire the Lefthand Wire Light's RGB[VECTOR] to RGB1_Front
    #8- Wire the Righthand Wire Light's RGB[VECTOR] to RGB2_Front
    #9- Repeat Steps 7 and 8 for the Rear Lights, if used. Obviously, those go to RGB1_Rear and RGB2_Rear.
    
    #How to Work the Ditch Lights:
    
    #Enable_Front and Enable_Rear turn on/off the automatic flashing when the horn is sounded. They do not force the lights to flash.
    #(Insert stupid snarky and infuriating remark about making BellToggle useless here)
    #Headlights_Front and Headlights_Rear make the lights come on solid.
    #The "Headlight" and "Enable" functionalities can be used independently or together!
    
    On = vec(255,255,200) #The color of the Lights
    ResidualBrightness = 0.25 #Value between 0 and 1 (full brightness), the minimum brightness during a flash cycle.
    Period = 1 #Time, in seconds, for one flash cycle.
    FlashDuration = 30 #Duration, in seconds, for lights to flash after the horn was used. Real locomotives use 30 seconds.
    
    #By FRA Standards (Post 1997):
    #The Ditch Lights should be white;
    #The Ditch Lights must be on if the locomotive is in motion (and by extension, if the headlight is on);
    #The Ditch Lights must flash alternately as the locomotive approaches a railroad crossing or any other high-traffic area (so they are often triggered by the horn);
    #If the headlight is over 60 units (60 inches) above the ditch lights, the ditch lights should be spaced 60 units apart;
    #Otherwise, if the headlight is less than 60 units above the ditch lights, they should be spaced 36 units (36 inches) apart;
    #The Flash Period must be between 0.33 and 1.5 seconds (or between 40 and 180 flashes per minute).
    
    #If your locomotive is set in a world pre-1997, you can ignore all the FRA restrictions.
